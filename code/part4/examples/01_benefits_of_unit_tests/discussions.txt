Code evolves constantly.

We fix bugs
We add new features
We enhance existing features

Two benefits to automated unit tests
1. Regression
2. Design

Regression benefit stays with us from the start to the end

You may outgrow the design benefit at some point. TDD serves as a nice
training wheel for design. You may reach a point of diminishing return
for the design benefits. But, your team members may still benefit from this
as they may be at a different level or are new to your team.
