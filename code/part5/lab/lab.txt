In this exercise we will create a program, test driven, for the zero player Game of Life:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life

The program will start with an input of a list of live cells. It will, at one second interval, display the cells that are live and dead. Each second, it will display the next generation of cells.

For the purpose of this lab we can assume the universe if finite in size where the size is specified when the program starts.

We will follow test first coding, no code unless a failing test demands it and minimum code to make tests pass. Let us take very small steps. 

Please keep your tests passing at all times. Keep the design lightweight and the code quality high. Please keep your task list on a piece of paper next to you.
