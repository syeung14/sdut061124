There are two benefits of automated unit tests:
1. Regression benefit
2. Design benefit

Regression benefit comes from the tests, irrespective of when those tests were written
- before the cod or after the code.

In general, it is harder to write good tests once the code is written.

The design benefit comes in only if we write the tests before the code is written.

We follow a rhythm in writing the tests and code.

one test
minimum code for that test to pass
refactor
repeat the steps
